---
## [3.7.1] — 2026-03-25

### Fixed

- **Decisions API Pagination** — Add missing `limit` parameter to CrowdSec API fetch, allowing import of >250 decisions. Fixes pagination issue where only first page was processed.
- **Monty Security C2 Source** — Disable by default; upstream removed `data/all.txt` file. Users can re-enable via `ENABLE_MONTY_SECURITY_C2=true` if alternative URL is confirmed.
- **NO_METRICS Environment Variable** — Add support for `NO_METRICS=true` as an alias for disabling metrics, in addition to existing `METRICS_ENABLED=false`.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Granular Firehol Level Control** — `ENABLE_FIREHOL` remains the master switch for all three Firehol levels, but you can now enable/disable individual levels with `ENABLE_FIREHOL_LEVEL1`, `ENABLE_FIREHOL_LEVEL2`, and `ENABLE_FIREHOL_LEVEL3`. Each level flag falls back to the master `ENABLE_FIREHOL` when unset, so existing configs are unchanged. Closes [#83](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/83)

---

## [3.7.0] — 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Interactive Setup Wizard** — New `--setup` flag launches an interactive first-time configuration wizard. Guides users through enabling/disabling blocklist sources and configuring API keys, writing a ready-to-use `.env` file. Ideal for new installs and Docker deployments. Closes [#61](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/61)
- **Homebrew Tap Support** — Added Homebrew installation instructions for macOS/Linux users (`brew install wolffcatskyy/crowdsec/crowdsec-blocklist-import`). See README for details.
- **AbuseIPDB Docs Clarification** — Improved `.env.example` to clearly distinguish the free public mirror (by @borestad, no API key required) from the optional direct API (`ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY`). Clarifies free tier limits (5 blacklist checks/day).

### Changed

- **BlocklistSource Standardization** — Refactored to use a unified `BlocklistSource` dataclass throughout, removing duplicated fetch/parse code paths. [#59](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/pull/59) (by @gaelj)

### Fixed

- **Custom Blocklist Loop** — Fixed undefined `source` variable in custom blocklist iteration that could cause `NameError` in certain configurations. [#59](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/pull/59) (by @gaelj)

### Contributors

- @gaelj — BlocklistSource standardization, custom blocklist fix

---

## [3.6.0] — 2026-03-07

### Added

- **CONSOLIDATE_ALERTS Option** — New `CONSOLIDATE_ALERTS=true` environment variable collects all IPs from all sources and sends a single CrowdSec alert per run instead of one per source batch. Helps free-tier users stay within the 500 alerts/month limit. Closes [#57](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/57)
- **Sentinel Turris Blocklist** — Added `sentinel.turris.cz/greylist-data` as a new blocklist source. [#55](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/pull/55) (by @gaelj)
- **AbuseIPDB API Key File** — Added `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY_FILE` config/env var for loading the API key from a file (Docker secrets compatible). [#50](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/pull/50) (by @gaelj)
- **Grafana Dashboard Improvements** — Enhanced Grafana dashboard with better visualizations. [#54](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/pull/54) (by @gaelj)
- **CI Workflow** — Added GitHub Actions CI with pytest, flake8, and syntax checks
- **Test Suite** — Added comprehensive pytest test suite (`test_blocklist_import.py`)
- **pip-installable Package** — Added `pyproject.toml` for `pip install crowdsec-blocklist-import` with proper entry point and optional extras
- **Documentation** — Added CHANGELOG.md, migration guide (`docs/migration-from-bash.md`), updated CONTRIBUTING.md

### Fixed

- **429 Rate-Limit Freeze** — Fixed a freeze that occurred when a blocklist source returned HTTP 429 (Too Many Requests). [#53](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/pull/53) (by @gaelj)
- **FetchResult Attribute Errors** — Fixed crashes from incorrect attribute names (`error_message` vs `error_exc`) and wrong constructor kwargs in error paths. Fixes [#52](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/52)
- **AbuseIPDB Test Failures** — Fixed failing error-path tests that expected pre-fix buggy behavior
- **Flake8 Lint Violations** — Cleaned up unused imports, ambiguous variable names, whitespace, and indentation issues across the codebase

### Removed

- **Spamhaus EDROP Blocklist** — Removed deprecated EDROP source. Spamhaus has merged EDROP into the main DROP list, so the EDROP URL now returns no IPs. The DROP source already includes all former EDROP entries. Fixes [#56](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/56)

### Contributors

- @gaelj — Sentinel Turris blocklist, AbuseIPDB key file, Grafana dashboard, 429 fix

## [3.5.0] — 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Built-in Scheduler/Daemon Mode** — Added `INTERVAL` environment variable. Run as a long-lived daemon instead of managing cron/systemd timers. Set `INTERVAL=3600` to repeat every hour. Graceful SIGTERM/SIGINT handling with current-run completion. Closes [#5](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/5)
- **Webhook Notifications** — Added `WEBHOOK_URL` and `WEBHOOK_TYPE` environment variables. Get import results pushed to Discord, Slack, or any generic JSON webhook endpoint after each run. Closes [#7](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/7)
- **AbuseIPDB Direct API Integration** — Added `ABUSEIPDB_API_KEY` environment variable. Query AbuseIPDB's blacklist API directly with configurable confidence threshold (`ABUSEIPDB_MIN_CONFIDENCE`, `ABUSEIPDB_LIMIT`). Provides higher-quality results than the community mirror. Closes [#15](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/15)
- **Spamhaus EDROP Blocklist** — Added EDROP (Extended DROP) source alongside the existing DROP feed for more aggressive reputation-based blocking
- **Per-Source Prometheus Metrics** — Enhanced metrics with proper label cardinality controls, per-source status tracking, error message sanitization, and improved Grafana dashboard

### Fixed

- **IPv4-Mapped IPv6 Filtering** — Add `::ffff:0:0/96` to private networks list. Correctly filters IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses (e.g., `::ffff:192.168.1.1`). Closes [#8](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/8)
- **Dangerous .0 Auto-Expansion** — Removed automatic expansion of `.0` addresses to `/24` CIDR blocks. This could inadvertently block 256 addresses when a single `.0` IP appeared in a blocklist
- **Type Hints** — Fixed `parse_ip_or_network()` return type hint (was `Optional[str]`, correctly returns `tuple`)
- **Type Hints** — Fixed `flush_batch()` return type hint (was `None`, correctly returns `tuple`)
- **Docker Release Tags** — Fixed Docker image version tags by triggering builds on release:published events instead of push:tags. Ensures Docker images match code versions. Closes [#41](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/41)

### Changed

- **Deprecated Legacy Bash Script** — `import.sh` is now deprecated. The Python version provides superior performance, memory efficiency, and feature parity. Existing bash users should migrate to the Python implementation
- **Prometheus Push Gateway** — Changed from listening mode to push mode (Prometheus Pushgateway integration)

## [3.4.0] — 2026-02-22

### Added

- **CIDR-Aware Allowlist Matching** — Enhanced allowlist system now correctly handles CIDR ranges in addition to individual IPs. Allowlist entries can now be a mix: `192.168.1.0/24,10.0.0.1,172.16.0.0/12`
- **GitHub IP Ranges Provider** — New `ALLOWLIST_GITHUB=true` environment variable. Automatically fetches GitHub's official IP ranges (git, web, api, hooks, actions) and adds them to the allowlist. Perfect for protecting GitHub Actions and webhook endpoints
- **Complete Documentation Rewrite** — Major README rewrite with accurate environment variables, corrected source lists, and proper GHCR image references. Added `docs/` directory with four comprehensive guides:
  - `config-reference.md` — Complete environment variable reference
  - `troubleshooting.md` — Common issues and solutions
  - `faq.md` — Frequently asked questions
  - `examples.md` — Deployment examples (Docker, Kubernetes, Synology, bare metal)

### Fixed

- **Documentation Accuracy** — Fixed ~25 critical inaccuracies from initial draft (wrong env var names, fabricated features, incorrect Python version requirements)

### Changed

- **Security Policy** — Added security advisory warning about malicious clones. Users are urged to verify they're using the official source at [wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import)

---

## [3.3.2] — 2026-02-18

### Fixed

- **Allowlist Parsing** — Fixed filtering of empty strings when parsing `ALLOWLIST` and `CUSTOM_BLOCKLISTS` environment variables
- **Credential File Support** — Restored CrowdSec credential file support in `read_secret_file()` function

### Changed

- **Documentation** — Cleaned up allowlist documentation. Noted that `ALLOWLIST_URL` and `ALLOWLIST_FILE` are planned for future releases (not yet implemented in Python version)

---

## [3.3.1] — 2026-02-17

### Fixed

- **Prometheus Metrics** — Fixed Prometheus Pushgateway integration to use push mode correctly

### Added

- **Grafana Dashboard** — Added built-in Grafana dashboard for Prometheus metrics visualization

---

## [3.3.0] — 2026-02-16

### Added

- **ENABLE_* Variable Validation** — Added startup validation for all `ENABLE_*` environment variables. Invalid values cause the importer to fail with clear error messages. Prevents silent misconfiguration
- **CLI Flags** — Added `--version`, `--help`, and `--list-sources` flags to `import.sh` (bash version)
- **Docker Secrets Support** — Improved Docker secrets support with `_FILE` environment variable suffix. Set `CROWDSEC_MACHINE_PASSWORD_FILE=/run/secrets/password` to read from mounted secrets

### Fixed

- **Prometheus Metrics** — Changed from Counter to Gauge for `errors_total` metric (more accurate for monitoring)

### Changed

- **NixOS** — Added NixOS packaging information to README for users on NixOS/NixOS-unstable

---

## [3.2.0] — 2026-02-16

### Added

- **Prometheus Metrics Endpoint** — Added Prometheus metrics endpoint. Tracks total IPs imported, deduplication rate, failed imports per source, and import duration. Closes [#34](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/34)

### Fixed

- **Allowlist Parsing** — Fixed parsing of empty strings in `ALLOWLIST` variable
- **Block-list Cleanup** — Improved cleanup of blocklist entries
- **Credential File Support** — Improved Docker secrets support for `_FILE` environment variable variants

### Changed

- **Logging** — Improved log messages and source identification

---

## [3.0.0] — 2026-02-11

### Added

- **Complete Python Rewrite** — Rewrote the entire tool in Python 3.11+ with major performance and efficiency improvements:
  - Memory-efficient streaming (handles 500k+ IPs without loading entire file into RAM)
  - 28+ blocklist sources (feature parity with bash version)
  - LAPI mode only (no Docker socket dependency)
  - Full IPv4/IPv6 support via Python's `ipaddress` module
  - Full type hints for better IDE support and error detection
  - Structured logging with configurable levels
  - Retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Docker-ready with `python:3.11-slim` image
  - `--dry-run`, `--help`, `--version` CLI flags

### Changed

- **Performance** — Improved import speed and memory usage compared to bash version
- **Architecture** — Removed Docker socket dependency; uses direct LAPI HTTP API

### Technical Details

- Single file implementation (~650 lines of production code)
- Dependencies: `requests`, `python-dotenv`, `prometheus-client`
- Memory usage: ~50-100MB for streaming 300k+ IPs
- Speed: 500-1000 IPs/second depending on network

---

## [2.1.0] — 2026-02-04

### Added

- **Device Memory Query** — Added `BOUNCER_SSH` environment variable to query bouncer device(s) before importing. Checks available memory and ipset headroom. Deploys lightweight memory agent script on first run
- **MAX_DECISIONS Guardrail** — Added `MAX_DECISIONS` environment variable. If set, the importer stops adding IPs once the total decision count in CrowdSec reaches this limit. Prevents overloading embedded devices like UniFi. Works as source-side layer of two-layer protection (device-side memory agent is layer 2)
- **Device Memory Floor** — Added `DEVICE_MEM_FLOOR` environment variable (default 300MB). Minimum MemAvailable to preserve on bouncer device(s)

### Fixed

- **MAX_DECISIONS Default** — Fixed default `MAX_DECISIONS=40000` to prevent UniFi Network app crashes. 120K+ decisions crash the app on all tested UniFi devices when bouncer pushes them into ipset. The 40K default works safely on all devices. Closes [#21](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/21)

---

## [2.0.0] — 2026-02-03

### Added

- **Direct LAPI Mode** — Added direct CrowdSec LAPI integration without Docker socket dependency. Set `CROWDSEC_LAPI_URL`, `CROWDSEC_MACHINE_ID`, and `CROWDSEC_MACHINE_PASSWORD` for direct LAPI connection
- **8 New Threat Feeds** — Added AbuseIPDB (99% confidence), Cybercrime Tracker C2, Monty Security C2, DShield Top Attackers, VXVault Malware, IPsum Level 4+, Firehol Level 3, and Maltrail Mass Scanners
- **One-Line Installer** — Added auto-detection installer script (`install.sh`) that detects CrowdSec environment (Pangolin, Docker Compose, standalone, native) and configures LAPI credentials automatically
- **Companion Projects** — Added crowdsec-unifi-parser to Related Projects

### Fixed

- **sudo PATH Issue** — Fixed PATH issues when running `sudo ./import.sh`. Commands like `docker` and `cscli` are now found regardless of how the script is invoked (added explicit PATH export at startup)

### Changed

- **Docker Removal** — Eliminated Docker socket requirement entirely. LAPI mode is now primary (closes [#9](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/9), [#10](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/10), and resolves core issue behind [#12](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/12))
- **IP Coverage** — Increased from 60k to 95k unique IPs after deduplication with 8 new feeds

---

## [1.1.0] — 2026-01-31

### Added

- **Selective Blocklists** — Added `ENABLE_<SOURCE>` environment variables to disable individual blocklist sources. Closes [#1](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/1)
- **Custom Blocklists** — Added `CUSTOM_BLOCKLISTS` environment variable to import custom threat feed URLs. Closes [#2](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/2)
- **Dry-Run Mode** — Added `DRY_RUN=true` mode to preview imports without making changes. Closes [#3](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/3)
- **Per-Source Statistics** — Added per-source statistics summary table printed after each run. Closes [#4](https://github.com/wolffcatskyy/crowdsec-blocklist-import/issues/4)
